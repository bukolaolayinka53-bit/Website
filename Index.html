        <h1>History of Adire</h1>
        <p>

    Adire is a traditional Yoruba tie-and-dye textile from southwestern Nigeria, especially Abeokuta. 
    It uses indigo dye and resist techniques to create intricate patterns. 
    Historically made by women, Adire designs symbolize cultural stories, identity, and social status. 
    Today, it remains a celebrated part of Nigerian heritage and fashion.
