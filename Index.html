        <h1>History of Adire</h1>
        <p>
            Adire is a traditional Yoruba resist-dyed cloth from southwestern Nigeria, especially Abeokuta, Ibadan, and Osogbo. 
            It developed in the 19th century when Yoruba women used handwoven cotton and natural indigo dye to create patterned fabrics. 
            Techniques such as tying (oniko), stitching (alabere), and starch-painting (eleko) were used to form unique designs. 
            In the early 20th century, Adire became a popular trade cloth across West Africa and later expanded with the introduction of synthetic dyes. 
            A revival in the 1960s through Osogbo art movements modernized the craft, helping it gain global attention. 
            Today, Adire is widely used in fashion and design, blending traditional methods with contemporary styles.
